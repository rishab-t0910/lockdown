I'll be using this README file to track each project, and a short summary of it. 

1. Running
This project came about because I wanted to learn how to combine python and excel (using openpyxl). As I run a frequent amount, I thought this would be the best way to combine the two as I track my stats on an excel sheet. 
The project takes in the date, duration, distance of the run and creates an excel sheet with this informatio, as well as overall analysis of pace, distance, time, and individual run pace.
