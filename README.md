I'll be using this README file to track each project, and a short summary of it. 

1. Running

This project came about because I wanted to learn how to combine python and excel (using openpyxl). As I run a frequent amount, I thought this would be the best way to combine the two as I track my stats on an excel sheet. 
The project takes in the date, duration, distance of the run and creates an excel sheet with this informatio, as well as overall analysis of pace, distance, time, and individual run pace. 

2. Master Schedule

This project tries to schedule a 8, 16, and 32 person squash draw. While 8 is straightforward in how to schedule, 16 and 32 are not. I tried to find the best way to schedule 16 and 32 without hardcoding it, but it is quite tough. Still trying to think of a solution. Maybe recrusive, and call the smaller method?
